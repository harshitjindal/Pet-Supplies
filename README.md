### Technology Stack:

-   Frontend: HTML / SASS / ReactJS
-   Backend and API: Django
-   Database: Google Firestore

# Idea

During the summers, we will be learning ReactJS, Django and Firestore to build a full stack Ecommerce web application for pet supplies in the Chandigarh Tricity Region. Currently, pet supplies available locally are of inferior quality and hard to procure, but with this service, everyone will have access to quality products for their pooches.

# Project Goals

-   Implement a Dynamic Frontend with ReactJS.
-   Develop Backend and RESTful API with Django.
-   Store data with Google Firestore.
-   Handle payments with Stripe and Paypal.
